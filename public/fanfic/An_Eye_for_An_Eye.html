      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>The act of gouging out your own eye is called <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/autoenucleation" rel="nofollow"> autoenucleation</a>, self-enuclation, or oedipism, "enucleation" being the general act of removing the eye (but leaving muscles intact). There's no tag for "autoenuclation" on AO3 --- it's a very uncommon word, it seems like, because even the text editor right now doesn't like it very much!</p>
<p>After enucleation, implants are inserted into the eye socket, but Eito doesn't do that here. He's only an amateur.</p></blockquote>

    <h2 class="toc-heading">An Eye for An Eye</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Some time ago, Takumi had been completely paralyzed. For the rest of the hundred days (however long that would be), he would be completely immobile and helpless. Stuck in his own mind, he only thought about a few things. Would they make it to the Artificial Satellite safely? How would his condition be explained? Surely, it wasn't a permanent thing?</p><p>There was a knock on the door. Just a formality, really — the door was never locked. It creaked open, and in stepped Eito. He was holding a tray with an assortment of surgical equipment. Takumi's heartbeat rose. </p><p>"Good morning, Takumi. You look so beautiful today. Did you sleep well?" He did, honestly. He had a good dream: a memory of him and Karua. Though it was impossible to go back, it gave him a little hope. </p><p>Eito continued, as if he <em>wasn't</em> just talking to a wall of flesh. "Takumi, you're the only person I love. You're the only human in this disgusting world who isn't horribly ugly. I am so grateful for your existence, every single day of my life… I don't care if it started because of some medication that you took. Thank you for giving my life meaning.</p><p>"But, still. Knowing how beautiful you are, I can't help but wonder how my abhorred classmates look through your eyes. I want to see everyone as you do, Takumi. Will you give me that chance?"</p><p>Takumi blinked — a "yes" in Eito's mind. "I'm glad, then."</p><p>With that, Eito took out a syringe and injected something into Takumi's jugular. His consciousness began to fade, and Eito stood there, watching closely as Takumi shut his sleepy eyes. </p><p>"I'm sorry…" </p><p>He wasn't going to be very good at this, but he didn't want to ask Yugamu for help. He didn't need Yugamu touching Takumi's body like that. He didn't need <em>anyone </em>touching Takumi's body like that, but perhaps that was too selfish of him.</p><p>Setting his tray on the bed, Eito began by retracting Takumi's right eyelids with an eye speculum. An elegant blue-red iris stared back. Everything about Takumi was so beautiful and perfect. He caressed Takumi's eye, getting aqueous humor on his black gloves. </p><p>He licked it; it had no particular taste, but he should've expected that — it was almost completely water. Still, licking one of Takumi's fluids… </p><p>He shook his head. Eito took a pair of conjunctival scissors (that looked similar to bowed tweezers, he thought) and cut in a circle between Takumi's cornea and sclera. This was a small cut made to expose the extrinsic eye muscles Eito needed to burn. Blood began to pool on the perimeter of Takumi's eyeball, but this was normal. It looked quite grotesque, regardless, and Eito now had to control his nausea along with his precision. </p><p>He relaxed from his position and set his tools down to take a breather. In, out, in, out. He couldn't vomit on Takumi, especially not while Takumi was asleep. Eito would have to clean that up for Takumi (and maybe that would be fine. He bathed with Takumi daily anyway), but Eito would never forgive himself. </p><p>Then, with his right hand, he picked up a surgical muscle hook and grappled one of Takumi's eye muscles: the lateral rectus, attached to the left side of the eye. His left hand grabbed a cautery pen and pressed the activation button. Slowly and carefully, he burned the muscle attached to the whites of Takumi's eyes. </p><p>The other five muscles weren't as stressful. Grab one, burn one, and find the next one. Even so, he was a complete amateur. Most importantly, this was Takumi! Eito would beat himself up if he ended up damaging any of Takumi's organs. What he was doing right now was barely acceptable in the first place!</p><p>That's why he couldn't afford to mess up. Setting down his tools and taking a breath, Eito steeled himself. He took another pair of scissors (enucleation scissors, which looked like regular steel scissors with a hook at the tip) and cut the optic nerve — right behind the sclera. </p><p>And that was it! An hour later, it was over. He removed the globe, then the speculum, leaving a red, irritated socket behind. And he had Takumi's recently severed eye right in his hands. The texture was like a gummy, if they were drenched in slime.</p><p>He didn't want to hold it for too long, yet. He placed it in the tray along with the other medical equipment. </p><p>Of course, he couldn't leave Takumi with a noticeable, gross wound. Eito applied a thick, white bandage to his right eye, which covered nearly the entire right half of his face. Eito was proud of his work, but there was one last thing he needed to do. </p><p>He took off his gloves and dug deep into his right eye, scratching like an irritating itch (you could argue that it was). He'd been growing out his nails, so they were around half an inch long. </p><p>The truth was, eyeballs were pretty delicate, just that most humans' self-preservation instincts would kick in if they even so much as brushed a finger on their eye. The outer layer was only tough to people who just didn't get it. </p><p>Despite this, it was painful. Extremely painful. Eito fell to his knees, groveling in pain. Naturally, it wouldn't be a walk in the park, and he didn't expect it to be. Accepting that it would hurt didn't make it hurt less, though. But, this is what he wanted to do. It was his decision; his future. </p><p>The right half of his face was now a mix of blood, tears, and general eye fluids — his right vision had entirely gone out by this point. His eye made repugnant sloshing and squishing noises while it fought for its tiny life. Unfortunately, it was going to lose this battle.</p><p>One final strong tug was all it took to separate his eye from its socket. He was in unbearable agony, but Eito smiled and squished the globe in his hands. It wasn't really a <em>globe </em>anymore, more like a deflated beachball. Some vitreous body decided to come out, regardless. He flinched. </p><p>He laid his eye right next to Takumi's on the tray, and stared at it for a good few minutes. If he stopped now, all of this would have been for nothing! So, delicately, he picked up Takumi's eye with his (clean) left hand and placed it into his socket.</p><p>Nothing happened. Obviously, nothing happened. He didn't regain his eyesight or suddenly get rid of his <em>cognitive</em> disorder. The optic nerve had already been severed; there was no coming back from that. What did he expect to happen?</p><p>He wiped the fluid cocktail off with his palms, and Takumi slowly opened his eye.</p><p>*</p><p>A few days later, Eito had been appropriately punished for spending too much time with Takumi. </p><p>Well, no. They just finished what Eito had started. </p><p>"I'm sad I can't look at Takumi anymore, but I don't mind not seeing your horrendous visages." Eito said post-surgery. Killing himself was not an option. His current state was already registered in the Revive-O-Matic, permanently. </p><p>He could still touch, taste, smell, hear Takumi, so not all was lost. His memory wasn't too bad, either: he could imagine Takumi if he wanted. Any scenario he wanted. </p><p>Eito's sockets had been fitted with prosthetic implants, while Takumi's eyes were safely kept in a tight jar. </p><p>The rest of the Special Defense Unit thought it better to remove the left eye, as well. What if Takumi's left eye started to experience pain because of Eito's extraction? How would they be able to tell, if he couldn't signal it?</p><p>While Takumi also had implants, they were eventually deemed too disturbing (no implants the Gift-O-Matic made were as charming as Takumi's eyes), and a blindfold was wrapped around Takumi's head instead. </p><p>A knock on Takumi's door. </p><p>"I'm coming in, okay?"

Eito again. He seemed to be getting adjusted quickly, all things considered. The door creaked open, and his sneakers made a thick sound when they collided with the floor, getting louder as he approached Takumi's bed.</p><p>He felt Eito push up the blindfold and touch his right implant, but not before touching the rest of his face to find it. "I truly am sad I cannot see you anymore. You were the only light in my life, and now my world is surrounded by darkness, but it's good to have a shared experience. I'll love you for as long as I live… Takumi, I can't stop thinking about you!"</p><p>There was a slight pull on Takumi's hair, then the sound of it rustling through Eito's gloves. "You have nice hair. Really, and it smells amazing. I wish I could shampoo your hair again…"</p><p>Finally, Eito felt around for Takumi's lips. He inserted his tongue into Takumi's mouth. "Ah… it's so nice to feel you. I can't be like this with anyone else."</p><p>Eito's mouth was uncomfortably hot. "I love you, Takumi. More than I've loved anything."</p><p>Suddenly, Eito's tongue exited forcefully, and Takumi felt a cold sensation on his skin. "No, sorry, I'm so sorry. I was supposed to give you your medicine and change your IV, not to do this!" </p><p>After a while, the door slammed shut, and there was only a faint mechanical buzz. </p><p>He wondered what Eito looked like.</p>
