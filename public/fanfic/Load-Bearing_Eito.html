    <h2>Load-Bearing Eito Aotsuki</h2>
      <p>In the morning, the members of the Special Defense Unit were chatting among themselves in the Cafeteria. An anguished scream could be heard: "My laundry keeps disappearing whenever I hang it out to dry! My hoodies, my socks, even my underwear one time."</p><p>"Huh, really, Takumi?" the boy next to him asked, picking at his food.</p><p>"Yes! It's so weird, Eito. A lot of other weird things have been happening recently, too, right?" Takumi sighed. "It's just one thing after another. It's exhausting."</p><p>"Right." </p><p>"I've just been making new clothes with the Gift-O-Matic, but I'd really like the ones I had back. If you ever see my clothes, could you bring them back to me?"</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>*</p><p>After breakfast, Eito made a beeline to his room. </p><p>The door opened and shut with a <em>click</em>. Eito ran to open the bottom drawer of his nightstand, and, without looking, randomly select an article of clothing: Takumi's underwear. Most of the clothes in that drawer were socks; Eito was glad he was lucky. He coated it with lube and sat down on his bed.</p><p>Already feeling his dick beg to be touched, he quickly undressed his lower half and began stroking his cock with Takumi's underwear. Soon enough, it had hardened. He stroked his shaft slowly.</p><p>It felt so good. Eito imagined Takumi's ugly face sucking on his huge dick, barely able to take it in without choking. Takumi would draw his final breath giving a blowjob to Eito, with the last taste he'd ever experience being cum in his mouth.</p><p>Eito would find that sort of thing awfully difficult to explain. He (quietly) moaned Takumi's name. No one could hear him, and yet, he was embarrassed. </p><p>This was new to him: as a young boy, he never masturbated, never had nocturnal emissions, never even had sexual thoughts until recently. Sexuality was one of the most sickening things, after all. He knew. To learn about humanity, he'd read countless pornographic and obscene novels. None of them "turned him on." The opposite! It made him disgusted! <em>How were people into these sorts of things? </em>he thought to himself.</p><p>But of course humanity made him disgusted. Humans were disgusting. Humans were all sorts of negative things. Ugly. Gross. Rotten. He could go on. He <em>could</em> go on, but… </p><p>Takumi. This meat-looking literal red-head fucked up his nearly two decade streak of not masturbating. Something about him enamored Eito in the worst way possible. Something he wasn't quite able to place yet.</p><p>He continued to stroke faster while thinking about how nasty Takumi was. The tension in his cock rose; his breathing became more pronounced, and he couldn't be quiet anymore, even though he tried to suppress it by biting his lips. While trying to focus on how fast his heart was beating or how hot his face was getting, his brain still wandered to Takumi, as if he was some schoolgirl with an intense crush on her classmate.</p><p>To be fair, it was difficult to think about anything else other than the boy whose clothes you were jerking off with. Takumi's scent had been off it from a long time, but Eito didn't mind. A good thing, in fact, because otherwise he'd likely have thrown up on his dick. Pressure built up quicker and quicker with each subsequent stroke.</p><p>He used his other hand to squeeze his nipple and cried out Takumi's name. He'd just have to hope nobody was listening too closely on him. At least he made sure he locked his door.</p><p>And he was very thankful for that, because he heard a knock on his door right as he climaxed, right into Takumi's underwear. "Eito?"</p><p>Takumi's voice. "Could I have a moment, please?" Eito replied, steadying his breathing. He put on a new pair of pants and underwear, and held Takumi's underwear behind his back, as if he always stood like that.</p><p>Upon opening the door, Takumi asked point-blank: "Have you been stealing my clothes?"</p><p>Eito denied it. </p><p>Takumi paused for a long second before smiling. "Okay, I believe you. I'm going around asking everyone the same question, and seeing who sounds the most suspicious."</p><p>Huh. For Takumi, that was surprisingly intelligent.</p><p>"Yugamu helped me come up with that idea."</p><p>Never mind.</p><p>"Honestly, Yugamu seems the most suspicious to me," Eito suggested. </p><p>"I thought so too, but Yugamu let me look through his room and the Bio Lab — nothing."</p><p>"Hm. Good luck asking everyone else, then."</p><p>After a quick goodbye, Eito slammed the door and threw the underwear into the sink to wash it. Eito would usually be happy cleaning things, but he only rapidly scrubbed the fluids off, up and down. Naturally, he didn't forget to give it one more wipe-down with his cock.</p><p>*</p><p>The next morning, Eito gave Takumi the majority of his clothes back. When asked how he obtained it, he told Takumi that he expertly blackmailed the thief: "I know who you are. Give Takumi's clothes back or I'll let everyone know you're a massive pervert!" And Takumi was completely convinced. </p><p>"Thank you so much, Eito."</p><p>"You're welcome. I made sure to wash them, too, just in case."</p><p>Takumi's face went as red as his hair. "Oh … thank you." He brought a hoodie to his nose and sniffed it. "Smells really good."</p><p>Ew. People really were foul. This disregard for tact was the second-worst thing he had to suffer through. </p><p>The worst thing he had to suffer through was getting a little hard because of this, and back in his room he came into one of Takumi's socks.</p><p>It's different when he's doing it.</p>
