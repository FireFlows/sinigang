    <div class="userstuff">
      <p><span>Takumi woke up to a note slipped under his door.</span></p><p><span><em>To my dearest Takumi,</em></span><br><span><em>I love you. Ever since I first saw you. It was like love at first sight.</em></span><br><span><em>But… I'm so nervous! I want you to meet me at the Gym right after the nighttime announcement, OK?</em></span><br><span><em>From, Your Secret Admirer</em></span></p><p><span>"Your Secret Admirer," huh? He wondered who it could be. Darumi didn't strike him as the romantic type, but perhaps…? Or was it one of the girls in the Last Defense Academy, like Kurara, or Kyoshika, or maybe, just, perhaps, maybe, it was…</span></p><p><span>He had to know. Sadly, there was one condition he needed to break: it was too dangerous to go alone. Sirei had been destroyed, Hiruko disappeared, and he couldn't risk anything just for some note. Even if he was deathly curious. </span></p><p><span>So, Takumi knocked on Kako's door.</span></p><p><span>"Kako," he said, putting a hand on her shoulder, "do you want to solve a mystery with me?" There was no way she could resist this, and she quickly probed for more information.</span></p><p><span>"What kind of mystery?"</span></p><p><span>"Earlier, I got this note—" Takumi held it up "— that says it's from my 'Secret Admirer.' It wants me to go to the Gym after the nighttime announcement." He crumpled the note back in his pocket.</span></p><p><span>"That sounds dangerous."</span></p><p>"Exactly. That's why I'm going to have you as backup. Can you hide somewhere in the Gym right before the nighttime announcement?"</p><p>"Hmm…" Kako thought, holding her hands together. "I guess I could do that, but…"</p><p>"Would Ima be a problem?"</p><p>"No… but I don't want to be hurt by this person…"</p><p>"Don't worry, Kako. I'm not going to let you get hurt. You can trust me."</p><p>Kako took a deep breath. "Okay. But could you please stop touching my shoulder?"</p><p>"Right. Sorry. See you later. Oh, and don't tell anyone about this." Takumi turned around to leave, and the letter fell out of his pocket.</p><p>*</p><p>The anticipation had been killing him all day. Takumi waited patiently in his room for the nighttime announcement to go off. When it did, he waited a few minutes before going down the stairs, and then a few seconds before opening the door to the Gym. Takumi felt his heart thump in his ears, nearly turning him deaf.</p><p>But when he opened the door, nobody was there. Not Kako, not any of the girls, no one. At least, that's what it looked like. Behind the pillar, someone began to approach him. Not Kako. Not any of the other girls.</p><p>"Takumi," a voice said. </p><p>"E-Eito?!"</p><p>"Didn't expect that a guy would be your secret admirer, did you?" Eito looked down at Takumi's shoes. "It's embarrassing, right? For a guy to like another guy."</p><p>"You shouldn't feel embarrassed. I accept you. I knew someone who was gay once."</p><p>Eito smiled. "Thanks, Takumi. I know you don't feel the same way, but I wanted to let you know, so there are no secrets left between us." He advanced further, until he was right in front of Takumi. Eito wrapped his arms around Takumi and squeezed tightly. That's when Takumi felt <em>something</em> rub up against him.</p><p>"Uh…Eito, I can feel underneath your jacket, you know."</p><p>"Wh-what?"</p><p>"Are you in your Class Armor?"</p><p>"Umm…"</p><p>"I felt your belt."</p><p>"Don't all guys wear belts?"</p><p>"Not on their waist!" He sighed. "Eito… do you really have a secret crush on me? Is that <em>really</em> the reason why you brought me here?"</p><p>Eito smacked his lips, and then smiled in a way Takumi hadn't seen before. "Well, you're a lot smarter than you look, Takumi. You're right; I <em>am</em> in my class armor, and that <em>isn't</em> the reason I brought you here. Because, in a few moments, you're going to —"</p><p>Eito was smacked in the back of his head, and with a thump, he landed on his face. Kako was standing right behind him, holding her gun. And Ima was there too. He kicked Eito's back, using the sharp point of his heel.</p><p>"Oh my god!" Takumi screamed.</p><p>"Don't you mean, 'thank you for saving my life,' Mister Sumino?" </p><p>"Bro– Ima saw the note you dropped and wanted to help, too," Kako explained. </p><p>Eito groaned in pain beneath Ima, blood and spit pooling on the floor. Takumi looked in shock. "Y-you can stop now, Ima."</p><p>"He was about to kill you! I'm doing you a favor; and! I still haven't heard 'thanks' yet."</p><p>"…Thank you. But let's get everyone else here too."</p><p>*</p><p>Eventually, everyone had gathered in the Gym. Eito was in a chair, tied up with hands behind his back. He'd transformed out of his class armor, and now was genuinely wearing his jacket. The rope was tied by Yugamu, which was obvious by the way he was tied. And how there was a ball gag in his mouth.</p><p>"Can you at least take the gag out? I don't like looking at this." Takumi trained his eyes to the floor.</p><p>"Sorry, was that a bit too much?" Yugamu asked. "I'll take it out, then." He slipped the gag off, drool trailing from the ball. Surprisingly, Eito didn't speak, and just sat slack-jawed. </p><p>"Eito, explain yourself," Ima said. "Did you really think that would work?"</p><p>"I–<em>oww</em>–I guess not," Eito admitted. "Takumi's stupid, but he's not <em>that</em> stupid, I suppose."</p><p>"Then what? What were you trying to do?"</p><p>"I don't know. I won't tell you."</p><p>"If you don't tell us, we'll gag you again."</p><p>"What? No, we're not doing that!" Takumi objected.</p><p>"Then do it," Eito said. "Since you want to."</p><p>Yugamu smiled as he approached Eito again, but Takumi stopped him, throwing the gag to the floor. "No! How about we just lock him somewhere he can't hurt anyone before he does anything? Like that room with all the coffin-looking things."</p><p>"I think that'd be great."</p><p>"No one's asking for your opinion!" Kurara yelled.</p><p>Unfortunately for Kurara, it was otherwise a unanimous vote to lock Eito up in the Strange Room indefinitely. Eito was still tied up, and while he was initially angry, he warmed up to it, oddly enough. It seemed almost enjoyable for him. </p><p>And a few days later, when Shouma checked the room to give Eito his morning meal, he couldn't find Eito anywhere.</p>
