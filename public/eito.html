    <h2>how did we get here?</h2>
    <p>People who know me know that I really, really, really like Eito. I have a crush on him, honestly, but I don't ship myself with him. This is mainly because I do not think he'd like me at all. Of course, he doesn't like anyone. Except for Takumi, probably.</p>
    <p>I mainly like Eito because I think he's cute. He's a shy, tall guy with glasses which is my taste in fictional men to a T. I knew from the second I saw him he was going to be one of my favorite characters of all time. In fact, he is my favorite character of all time. Because he's so cute.</p>
    <p>At the same time, I understand why people wouldn't like him. I respect people who hate Eito, because if he wasn't my type I'd hate his ass too.</p>
