    <p>WORK IN PROGRESS!</p>
    <h2>fanfic</h2>
    <p>If Archive of Our Own ever goes down or anything I've put a bunch of my fanfic for Hundred Line here too. Everything here is Eito/Takumi. (I'm not particular about top/bottom dynamics but so far I've only written top Eito.) Not spoiler-free; I recommend at least getting through route 0 before reading any of my fics. Listed in reverse chronological order. My fics are archive locked and the direct links will not work without an AO3 account.</p>
