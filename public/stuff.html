    <h2>fanfic</h2>
    <p>If Archive of Our Own ever goes down or anything I've put a bunch of my fanfic for Hundred Line here too. Everything here is Eito/Takumi. Not spoiler-free; mostly contains spoilers for Route 0. Listed in reverse chronological order. My fics are archive locked and the direct links will not work without an AO3 account.</p>
