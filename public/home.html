		<h2>WARNING</h2>
		<p>My website is for <b>mature audiences only</b>. My fics (which I've hosted here!) contain gore (especially self-harm) and are occasionally sexually explicit. There are suggestive and gory drawings. I say bad words. If you are under the age of 18 or uncomfortable with the topics shown on this website, please do not continue further. </p>
		<p>Technically works on mobile, but it's a bit cumbersome and you have to zoom in a lot. Desktop preferred.</p>
		<p>Additionally, there are tons of spoilers for Hundred Line. If you have any intention of playing it at all, I'd recommend buying it and playing through the whole game before coming back. It's worth it. It's a really good game.</p>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Hi, my name is Fire and this is my website. It's a major work-in-progress right now, but I'm slowly but surely working on it! </p>
		<p>I like <a href="eito.html">Eito Aotsuki</a> and the color purple. I'm a huge eitakuei fan! </p>
		<p>I turned off my site profile. If you need to contact me, please send a message through any of my accounts or my email, but note I don't check message requests often. If you need a quick response I recommend emailing me because I get notfications for it.</p>
		<p>Sinigang is a sour Filipino soup. I'm bad at coming up with usernames, and I thought it would be fun to name my page after it.</p>
