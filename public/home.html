		<h2>WARNING</h2>
		<p>My website is for <b>mature audiences only</b>. My fics (which I've hosted here!) contain gore (especially self-harm) and are occasionally sexually explicit. There are suggestive and gory drawings. I say bad words. If you are under the age of 18 or uncomfortable with the topics shown on this website, please do not continue further. </p>
		<p>Additionally, there are tons of spoilers for Hundred Line. If you have any intention of playing it at all, I'd recommend buying it and playing through the whole game before coming back. It's worth it. It's a really good game.</p>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Hi, my name is Fire and this is my website. It's a major work-in-progress right now, but I'm slowly but surely working on it! </p>
		<p>I like <a href="eito.html">Eito Aotsuki</a> and the color purple. </p>
		<p>I plan to make my own website layout eventually; for now, I modified <a href="https://teppyslayouts.neocities.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the first layout from this website</a>.</p>
