		<h2>WARNING</h2>
		<p>MY FANFICS CONTAIN TOPICS THAT ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR THOSE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. Gore, self-harm, and general NSFW content comes up often. More specific warnings are listed under each fic.</p>
		<p>If you cannot handle mature topics I advise not clicking on any fanfic links. Also I say bad words sometimes. Like fuck. </p>
