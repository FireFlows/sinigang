		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Hi, welcome to my website! Last updated: 2.6.26 at 8:50 PM EST.</p>
		<p>I plan to make my own website layout eventually; for now, I modified <a href="https://teppyslayouts.neocities.org">the first layout from this website</a>.</p>

		<h2>WARNING</h2>
		<p>MY FANFICS CONTAIN TOPICS THAT ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR THOSE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. Gore, self-harm, and general NSFW content comes up often. More specific warnings are listed under each fic.</p>
		<p>If you cannot handle mature topics I advise not clicking on any fanfic links. Also I say bad words sometimes. Does not include blinking/flashing lights. Works poorly on mobile. Most links will open in a new tab. </p>
