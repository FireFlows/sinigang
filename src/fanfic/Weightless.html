    <h2>Weightless</h2>
      <p>Takumi's sailing ship had been going towards the east for multiple days now. He was glad he didn't have to steer it himself — thanks to automation — but he still had to be on high alert. This technology was new, and no one exactly knew what creatures were roaming around on a previously unexplored planet.</p><p>His mission was to explore the planet, called KXK-787, detail a map, and send the information back to the people on the Artificial Satellite. From the analysis they had gathered so far, it seemed quite similar to Earth.</p><p>And from Takumi's experience, it was. Well, he'd never <em>been</em> to Earth, but it was probably a lot like KXK-787, guessing from information he already had. Breathable, not too hot or too cold. The sea smelled salty. A soft breeze tickled Takumi's hair. The nighttime sky was dotted with stars.</p><p>And there seemed to be human-like creatures living on it!</p><p>His eyes widened, his fifth cup of coffee not helping. He shouted out to his crew: "Guys, what is that?"</p><p>"What is <em>what</em>?" Gaku said, sipping on a juice box. He promptly dropped it when he looked at where Takumi was pointing. The crew started to yell over each other.</p><p>"Holy shit!"<br>
"Oh, he's really pretty."<br>
"Are you sure that's a guy?"<br>
"Is that a mermaid?"<br>
"Damn, I wish we had mermaids in the complex."<br>
"No, that <em>is</em> a guy, right? He'd be a merman."<br>
"<em>I</em> wish we had mermen in the complex."<br>
"We have to remain cautious. It could be dangerous."<br>
"'It?' That's a whole-ass dude! Well, half of one."<br>
"If he's going to cause trouble, I'll give him a side headlock!"<br>
"Stop freaking out, all of you are scaring him!"</p><p>Slowly, they all quieted down. Takumi stopped the automatic steering to get a better analysis of the situation.</p><p>Perched on a rock was an elegant boy. He had pale skin and hair, and a torso showcasing his toned stomach, but that's where the similarities between him and humans ended. The lower half of his body was covered in blue-green scales, with a large fish tail where his feet would be. He was around some meters away; among the sea of nothing, he stood out like a lighthouse.</p><p>Then, the boy began to sing. "Everyone, cover your ears!" Takumi ordered. He had a bad feeling about this creature.</p><p>His crew did as they were told. A few even shouted "aye, aye, captain!" at him. If there was any danger lurking, Takumi would investigate it himself. He couldn't bear the concept of losing his friends.</p><p>While Takumi couldn't understand the language, the boy's voice was sweet and alluring. Soft, too — it made Takumi feel safe. Takumi grabbed a life jacket and jumped into the water. "Ah!"</p><p>Goosebumps rose on his body. Cold, cold, cold! But he had to make his way to the merman. He <em>had</em> to! His song and beauty were hypnotizing to Takumi. He needed to see that boy!</p><p>A short while later, he touched the rock that the boy was sitting on. "C-can you understand me?" Takumi asked.</p><p>"Indeed I can, Takumi. I'm so glad that you were able to make it here."</p><p>"How do you know my name!?"</p><p>"It wasn't that hard to figure out. I just had to listen into your conversations and inspect the ship while you were asleep. I've been keeping tabs on you for quite a while, now. With how little you know your own ship, can you even call yourself the captain? I know about you, your friends, and so many things about disgusting humans. You're trying to outline a map of our world, right?"</p><p>What the hell? How did they not see a half-human half-fish before? Takumi decided to ignore the unsavory parts and replied solemnly: "Yes. I'm a sailor and cartographer."</p><p>He smiled. "Takumi, I can only wish to be as naive as you." He held out his hand. "You look cold. Come here."</p><p>Takumi took his hand; the merman hoisted Takumi onto the rock he was sitting on. Up close, this guy was even cuter than before. His hair was slightly wet, giving it a nice shine, and his long eyelashes complimented his purple eyes. Takumi caught himself staring a bit too long, and had to say something quickly.  </p><p>"Th-thank you."</p><p>"No problem. You looked like you were about to get hypothermia, so I helped a little."</p><p>"Aren't you going to…kill me or something?"</p><p>The boy laughed. "If I wanted to do that, I would've done it already. I was <em>supposed </em>to, but I felt bad for you."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>Instead of answering, the boy asked a different question. "Why do you think the people of the Tokyo Residential Complex haven't been contacting you?"</p><p>Okay, and how did he know about <em>that</em>? There really was no keeping secrets. Takumi stayed silent; to be honest, he felt sick thinking about it.</p><p>"If you think it's because they abandoned you, you're correct. Well, more so that they never cared in the first place.</p><p>"You're not getting back home. To them, you're dispensable. You and all your friends. When your research is completed and sent, your ship is automatically set to self-destruct. You won't even know it's coming. Isn't that sad? Humanity is so disgusting, treating people like pawns for their little game of chess." The boy sighed. "So it's kind of 'I feel bad for you' but also 'you're going to die no matter what I do, anyway.'"</p><p>Dispensable pawns. It made too much sense. The ship was never the best quality to begin with, and the crew spent a lot of their time trying to repair it. The automation was kind of shit. The limited supplies they had which were only good for around a hundred days (which was not enough to circumnavigate an entirely new planet).</p><p>"..." What was there to say?</p><p>"Do you believe me?"</p><p>"Y-yeah. Of course. I have no reason not to believe you." </p><p>"I'm gl—"</p><p> A loud honking noise startled both the boy and Takumi. His ship! His crew! They'd finally found him. </p><p>"Takumi!!" Tsubasa screamed. She wore noise-cancelling earbuds, so Takumi gave her a small wave. The ship blew its horn again, and Takumi jumped down back into the frigid water. A rope descended from the main deck.</p><p>"Takumi! Come on!" Tsubasa yelled. "What are you waiting for?"</p><p>What <em>was</em> he waiting for? He tried to grab onto the rope, but…</p><p>"I can't get on the ship."</p><p>"What?" Tsubasa removed her earbuds. "Sorry, do I need to keep those on?"</p><p>"I said I can't get on the ship. … And no, you don't need to."</p><p>"Why can't you get on?"</p><p>"Our ship is rigged to explode once we complete our mission. We can't get back on there. It's unsafe."</p><p>"I mean," Tsubasa said, "I could probably figure out how to disable it." Damn, of course. Tsubasa was a prodigy with machines; he should've thought about asking her first thing.</p><p>No matter what, they were never being rescued, but not being blown up was definitely an improvement. But Takumi shook his head. "No, I don't want to get on. Even if you disable it, we're stranded on an entire planet with no chance of rescue."</p><p>"Then what <em>do</em> you want to do?"</p><p>"I want to stay with the merman." They would need a translator anyway, no? Besides, he was just so charming and enchanting and beautiful. Why <em>wouldn't </em>someone want to stay with him?</p><p>"Oh my God, you've lost it. I guess we'll get you up here the hard way."</p><p>A new rope: this one had a hook on the end. It came down from the main deck to the sea, just like before, and almost snatched Takumi, but not before he was pulled under.</p><p>*</p><p>When Takumi opened his eyes, he coughed up saltwater. The back of his throat itched, and his back was covered entirely by sand. (He coughed up some sand, too.) It was bright and hot outside. Was this what summer felt like?</p><p>"Takumi." A figure emerged from the ocean. He immediately recognized it.</p><p>"It's you… what happened?"</p><p>"I helped you out. Pulled you into the water and took you to a nearby landmass. Aren't I nice?"</p><p>"Are you about to kill me?"</p><p>"I've said this before, and I'll say it again: I have no interest in killing you, because you're going to die here with or without my intervention."</p><p>"Oh." He almost forgot about that. Abandoned by the Tokyo Residential Complex, and now he was abandoning his friends for some guy he just met last night. Takumi wondered what they were doing now; probably searching for him. He wished they wouldn't do that. He was fine as he was right now.</p><p>"Can you sing for me again?" Takumi requested.</p><p>Begrudgingly, the merman complied with his request. Although Takumi still could not understand the language, he could tell that this was a different song than before. This was more like a lullaby, than anything.</p><p>"Mm."<em> Hey, maybe dying right here wouldn't be so bad</em>, Takumi thought. He quickly drifted off to sleep.</p>
