    <h2>Between a Rock and a Hard Place</h2>
      <p><span>Takumi was pretty sure his classmate had been stalking him. A tall, pale, sickly boy named Eito Aotsuki. No, he <em>knew </em>Eito was stalking him. When he was out shopping, white hair would pass him by every so often. Takumi would go into the bathroom to eat, and Eito would be right behind him. </span></p><p><span>Following him to the station. Riding on the same train as him. Following him home. Stealing his clothes (mainly undergarments; Takumi had to buy a lot more recently). Looking outside his apartment window (how did he get up there?).</span></p><p>"It's just a coincidence," he was told by his teachers and every other adult in his life. Many people had white hair and were tall. He could name a couple right now. He was just seeing things because he was paranoid. </p><p>Eito was the type of guy to <em>avoid </em>people! A loner with no friends, often lost in his own world reading a book. Refused to speak unless spoken to… except, no. Takumi couldn't lie to himself anymore. This couldn't be a coincidence; he knew something was wrong, and yet, nobody would listen to him. </p><p><span>He had to take matters into his own hands.</span></p><p><span>During lunch at school, Takumi excused himself to the bathroom, and suddenly, Eito needed to go, too. Eito did have some sort of disorder, but Takumi didn't think it was related to bowel movements — he had always guessed more of a psychological thing.</span></p><p>While walking to the bathroom, Eito tried to start up a conversation: "So, how have you been lately?" When Takumi's pace quickened, Eito's followed suit. "You're really fast, Takumi-kun. Are you trying to run away from me?" </p><p>"No."</p><p>"We missed the bathroom, you know." Eito pointed behind him with his thumb.  In silence, Takumi walked to the boys' bathroom, slammed the door shut, and twisted the lock. If someone else needed to use the bathroom, they'd have to look for another one.</p><p>Takumi took a deep breath. "Aotsuki."</p><p>Eito tilted his head. "Yes?"</p><p>"Are you following me?"</p><p>"Um, where is this coming from?"</p><p>"We go to the same station. We ride the same train. You walk right behind me up until I get home. And I know you're stealing my clothes too!"</p><p>Eito blinked slowly. "Takumi-kun, we live in the same apartment complex."</p><p>"Seriously?"</p><p>"I live a couple doors down from you."</p><p>"Really. Then how about… you following me into the bathroom?"</p><p>"I have gastrointestinal issues, so I need to use the bathroom a lot. Irritable bowel syndrome. You're being really paranoid, Takumi-kun. Can I… use one of the stalls now?"</p><p>Huh. Perhaps Eito was right; Takumi <em>had</em> been severely over-thinking. He still didn't know what was happening to his clothes, but he supposed there was some normal explanation for it. Eito went into a stall and locked the door, but something fell out of his pants pocket while doing so. "Hey, Aotsuki, you dropped s—"</p><p>Takumi's heart stopped the moment he realized what he was looking at. A photo of him, in his room, only wearing boxer briefs. </p><p>Why did Eito have this? How did Eito have this? When was this taken? Around a hundred questions entered Takumi's mind as his hands trembled. In a way, it was almost like he was vindicated: he wasn't paranoid or crazy!</p><p>Keyword, almost. Around a minute later, Eito exited the stall (Takumi didn't hear the toilet flush, so what the hell was he doing in there?), but just as Eito closed the door, Takumi slammed his fists on either side of Eito.</p><p>Takumi then leaned in close. "Aotsuki. What's with the photo I just found that fell out of your pocket?"</p><p>"Oh, so you saw that."</p><p>"Yes, I did! What the fuck is that?!"</p><p>"C-calm down first, Takumi-kun. There's an explanation for it, if you'd listen!"</p><p>"Shut the fuck up!" Takumi took a few long, deep breaths. He'd been doing this a lot, recently. "So you've been stalking me. Why? For how long?"</p><p>Eito conceded. "I admit it. I've been stalking you." He sighed. "But I really <em>do</em> live a few doors down from you, and I really <em>do</em> have gastrointestinal issues."</p><p>"That doesn't matter. Do you know how insane I've been because of you? You've been stealing my goddamn clothes!"</p><p>"I suppose I got a little carried away there."</p><p><em>A little carried away there? </em>"Give them back."</p><p>"I could, but you wouldn't like the state they're in."</p><p>Deep breaths. Deep breaths. "What?"</p><p>"I… you know."</p><p>"No, I don't know. Could you tell me what <em>state they're in</em>?" Takumi used his knee to press on Eito's crotch, hoping it'd hurt. Eito's face turned bright red, and his breath slightly hitched, like Takumi was choking him. </p><p>Rationally, he should've stopped, but Takumi was nearly oblivious to Eito's reaction. He continued to grind his knee against Eito. </p><p>"What are you— ah, what are you doing, Takumi-kun?" His words came out wet with saliva.</p><p>"You didn't answer me before. Tell me: why have you been stalking me?"</p><p>"W-Well," Eito began, squirming, "I–um–well, it's hard to focus when you're doing <em>that</em>."</p><p>"What…do you mean…?"</p><p> Looking down for the first time, Takumi saw Eito's boner strain against his pants. Not like he couldn't feel it, but seeing it was a different thing entirely. Takumi didn't want it to be real. This couldn't be something that was actually happening to him, right? Eito's dick was leaking pre-cum, and Takumi was getting his pants stained with it. No, he was feeling something else. This was something else! Takumi wished he had just believed everyone else before.</p><p>"Oh," Takumi said.  </p><p>Unfortunately, the truth was right in front of him. He had Eito right under his knee. And he was using this control to jerk Eito off. </p><p>Takumi was jerking Eito off. </p><p>Takumi immediately moved his leg back down, but the pressure finally being lifted from his cock made Eito finally release the tension he'd been building. Eito cried out like he was about to die.</p><p>In fact, Takumi was about to ask if Eito was okay (not like he cared; it was mostly instinctual), but Eito had already rushed to the sink to vomit, making another horrible noise in record time. With how easily Eito slipped under Takumi, he wondered why Eito didn't just do that before.</p><p>A few minutes of retching later, Eito spoke up. "Sorry, I said I'd tell you why I've been stealing your clothes, but I didn't have the chance to. It's pretty simple, actually. It's because I love y—"</p><p>Eito's eyes bulged as he craned down to the sink and threw up again.</p><p>"Does the thought of being in love with me really make you vomit?" Takumi asked.</p><p>"Actually, yes. The thought of being in love with anyone is quite disgusting to me."</p><p>"Damn. You must have had a shitty childhood." He almost felt bad for Eito. Almost. </p><p>"I was in the hospital for most of it, so, yes."</p><p>"Are you better now? Since you can go to in-person school?"</p><p>Eito stared at Takumi for a while. Takumi stared back, trying not to look at the dark spot in Eito's pants. Instead of responding, Eito threw another question back at him: "Hey, Takumi-kun. I promise to give it back, so, can you please lend me your jacket?"</p><p>"Aotsuki, you can use your own jacket."</p><p>"Oh, right. Sorry."</p><p>Eito went into the same stall he was in half an hour prior. When he came out, Takumi nearly yelped. "Did you not have any spare pants?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"You should wear something else besides underwear on your legs! Our school probably has something."</p><p>"I'm not wearing dirty clothes from the school."</p><p>*</p><p>The rest of the day passed by without any other major incident. Takumi's classmates were shocked to see Eito not wearing his iconic jacket; when asked, Eito would say he'd pissed himself. Admitting to that was so embarrassing that nobody suspected him of lying.</p><p>At the end of the school day, Takumi and Eito waited at the same station, rode the same train, and walked home together. Every time Takumi would run faster, Eito would easily catch up to him. Eventually, he just gave up entirely.</p><p>"Takumi-kun, you're so nice!" Eito said, readjusting his jacket every thirty or so seconds. </p><p>"I'm calling the police on you when we get home. For breaking into my apartment and stealing my stuff."</p><p>"Is it 'breaking in' if your door was unlocked?"</p><p>Shit. He always had a bad habit of not checking twice before he left. He almost burned the whole apartment complex down once because he forgot to turn off the stove. Thinking about it now, maybe Eito was the one who turned it off.</p><p>"I'm pretty sure it is. Also, we're not friends, Aotsuki."</p><p>"But we bonded so deeply in the bathroom."</p><p>"What? No we didn't. We're not friends, you take creepshots of me half-naked." Takumi realized he still had that photo in his jacket; he inconspicuously ripped it apart inside.</p><p>When Takumi arrived at his apartment door, he unlocked it as soon as possible and ran inside. He triple made sure to lock the door again and called the police.</p><p>No time was wasted. "It's you with that stalker problem again. Takumi Sumino." The voice on the line was male, likely mid-thirties.</p><p>"Yes, and he finally admitted to it! His name is Eito Aotsuki and he lives a few doors down from me in apartment 8D! Check his apartment, it has to have my missing clothes!"</p><p>"Do you have an audio recording of this Aotsuki person admitting to it?"</p><p>"No, I didn't think about doing that."</p><p>"We can't search his apartment without evidence. You're going to need something."</p><p>"That makes no sense! I've never heard of that, that's just some bullshit you made up!" Takumi screamed, but it fell on deaf ears. The call had already been disconnected.</p><p>At some point, he had to wonder if adults were ignoring his issues on purpose. "Whatever," he sighed. "I'll just go to bed."</p><p>But not before he put a chair on his doorknob.</p><p>*</p><p>Takumi woke up in the dead of night with someone on top of him. It was dark, but he immediately knew.</p><p>Eito was on top of him, staring at him. He tried to scream, but his vocal chords wouldn't work and his mouth wouldn't open. He tried to hit Eito, but his body wouldn't move. Takumi looked down — at least his eyes still worked — to see his bottom half completely exposed. Somehow, he had gotten hard from this, too. At least he still had his shirt on. </p><p>"Takumi-kun? I didn't expect you to wake up." Eito's smooth voice cooed.</p><p>He tried to project his thoughts into Eito's mind: <em>Aotsuki, get off me!</em></p><p>Eito didn't get the message and moved his dick deeper inside Takumi. As if rehearsed, as if he'd done this many times before. It hurt, but Takumi could do nothing to relieve that pain. </p><p>"You feel amazing, Takumi-kun." He played a little with Takumi's hair. "You should really take a shower, though. Your hair is very greasy."</p><p>No, he took a shower right before he went to bed… he thought. Trying to dissociate, Takumi tried to close his eyes. He wasn't able to, so he stared at the wall, but the creaking of his bed and the moans of Eito (and the pain of Eito's dick inside him) kept bringing him back to reality.</p><p>"Takumi-kun, are you speechless?" Eito chuckled. "Just kidding. That's a slow-acting pill; I put it in your drink during lunch. Yugamu made it for me. Of course, he didn't know what it was for.</p><p>"Have you given up yet, Takumi-kun? Are you hopeless? Sorry, I know you can't respond, but I can imagine what you'd say."</p><p>Takumi screamed, in his head. </p><p>Eito leaned in to Takumi's ear and whispered: "Takumi-kun, I'm going to cum inside you. I can feel it. I'm nearly there."</p><p>A few seconds later, he did. Removing his cock, Eito made a weird noise and breathed heavily, enough for Takumi to hear it clearly. "Ah…it's almost better when you're awake, Takumi-kun." He kept overdoing the <em>Takumi-kun</em> thing. "I didn't even throw up on you this time. Anyway."</p><p>He kissed Takumi's forehead, holding his breath for a few seconds. "I'll see you later."</p><p>*</p><p>…and then, Takumi woke up. The first thing he did was remove his blanket. He still had his pants on. He could <em>remove his blanket</em>! </p><p>He breathed a deep sigh of relief and yelled triumphantly. A nightmare! He had a nightmare. That's all that it was. With a newfound happiness, he got out of bed and got dressed for school.</p><p>After eating breakfast, Takumi went outside and felt the calm fall breeze on his face. </p><p>"Good morning, Taku—ow!"</p><p>Takumi had kicked Eito in the nuts. Fuck, wouldn't he be into that sort of thing, though?</p><p>"How many times do I need to tell you: we're not friends! Leave me alone!" </p><p>"I still have to follow you to school. Besides, it's rude not to say 'good morning.'"</p><p>The boy who stole his clothes was talking about being rude. Takumi would laugh, but it was no longer funny. Even if it wasn't real, he couldn't get that dream out of his head. And he was stealing Takumi's clothes; that was a real thing that actually happened. </p><p>Instead of going to the train station, Takumi went back inside his apartment (Eito sighed, but continued to the station alone) and redid the chair barricade. Climbing back into his bed, he stared at the ceiling. When his eyes began to close, the thought of Eito on top of him opened his eyes right back up. </p><p>Dream Eito got something right. Takumi was hopeless. Takumi had given up. His parents were busy on a trip for the week, so he had the whole week to stay in his bed and do nothing. It was better to do this, anyway. As long as he was awake, he'd know for sure that Eito hadn't trespassed. Nothing bad could happen to him, if he stayed where he was. He smiled, comforted.</p><p>A gentle gust of wind came out from Takumi's window.</p>
