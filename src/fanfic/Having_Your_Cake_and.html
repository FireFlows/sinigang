    <h2>Having Your Cake (and Eating It Too)</h2>
      <p>Eito was an impossible character to predict. His brain seemed to operate on a completely different level, not in a sense of "oh, this guy's too intelligent that I'd never be able to understand him!" This was more like "is this guy crazy or what?"</p><p>And his next psychotic stunt was removing his own eyes. Takumi saw it himself – ripped clean off, as if they were never attached to his brain in the first place (which might be true). This was an expression of goodwill. His own fucked up idea of goodwill.</p><p>After that lovely display, Takumi went back to his room to bleach that scene out of his mind when his doorbell rang. Twice. Three times. Four times …</p><p>He finally opened the door, and Eito calmly invited himself in, albeit almost crashing into Takumi. "Hey, watch where you're going!" Takumi shouted.</p><p>"I can't."</p><p>"Oh. Yeah, I'm going to have to get used to that. What are you here for, anyway?"</p><p>Eito turned away from Takumi. "Since I'm blind, I need help getting around school. I thought I would be fine without any help … and I mostly am. I just need your help for a bit, Takumi. Won't you please help me?"</p><p>"Do I have a real choice?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Well. Alright, then. Could you please face the other way, though? You're talking to the wall."</p><p>"Can't do that either, I'm afraid. Your nauseating stench is almost too powerful if I'm facing you. And your voice sounds less grating here, too. And I can almost picture your –"</p><p>"Umm, so, I just have to help you around school, right? How should I do that?"</p><p>Eito paused for a second. "Hold my hand," he said, and before Takumi had a chance to interject, he continued. "It's fine. I'm wearing gloves, so your disgusting, slimy hands won't bother me as much."</p><p>Takumi's face turned red. The only time he ever held hands with someone was with Karua, but even then, that was just a fake memory. It wasn't like a first kiss or anything, but did he really want to hold hands with Eito?</p><p>"I can sense that you're blushing. Don't worry, it's fine. Since you're in love with Nozomi, anyway." And Takumi thought Eito was on his side!</p><p>So, that's how Eito and Takumi ended up holding hands and traversing around the school. There were many weird looks, but it was fine. After all, they were just friends helping out each other.</p><p>"Yep. Aren't we best friends?" Eito said, smiling in Takumi's direction.</p><p>"Gah!"</p><p>Eito laughed, as if that was funny at all. "I'm not psychic, sorry. My intuition must've gotten better when I took out my eyes, too!"</p><p>Eventually, they had made their way back to the Cafeteria, where Eito finally took his hand off of Takumi. Sitting down at a table with little difficulty, he clasped his hands together. "I'm hungry."</p><p>Now Takumi was supposed to feed Eito, or something? Whatever. It's better than what happened in the last 100 days. Even though that was really cutting it close.</p><p>"Are you craving anything in particular? I could go get it for you."</p><p>"I would like … a cake."</p><p>A cake. Sure. With the Ration-O-Matic's help, he made a carrot cake. Takumi didn't know if Eito liked carrot cake, but it was a pretty popular flavor that most people could tolerate. And if he didn't, Takumi could make a different flavor.</p><p>After setting it on the table, Eito asked the question Takumi was afraid of: "Could you help feed me, Takumi?"</p><p>Unfortunately for Takumi, he was already too deep into this. Takumi sat down, took a spoonful of cake, and delicately put it in Eito's mouth. "Mgh, is this carrot cake?" Eito asked in the middle of chewing.</p><p>"It is. Do you like it?"</p><p>"Sure!"</p><p>Sure?</p><p>After a while, Eito spoke again. "Takumi, you should try some too. It's delicious."</p><p>Don't mind if I do, Takumi thought. Surely, taking a tiny bit shouldn't cause too much harm. He picked up a spoonful and shoved it into his mouth. "Huh, you're right. This is pretty g–"</p><p>Suddenly, Eito grabbed Takumi's face and unceremoniously smashed their faces together. Takumi sputtered as Eito tried to get inside Takumi's mouth. "H-hey, what the hell are you doing?!" Takumi screamed. "This isn't some sort of gay fanfic, you can't just –"</p><p>No, this was the wrong route for meta jokes. And once again, he was cut off, as his blabbering provided the perfect opening for Eito to stick his tongue in. He gently licked the cake on the inside of Takumi's mouth.</p><p>Eito had swiftly stolen Takumi's first kiss. If you could even call it that. Really, Eito was just prodding around in Takumi's mouth… and Takumi was going along with it… for an unknown reason. After a good thirty seconds, Eito pulled away slowly, trailing saliva between their lips. They were still close enough that Takumi felt Eito's sweet, hot breath.</p><p>"I'll never get used to the taste of you, but the cake is delicious," Eito said, smiling.</p><p>Or, that's what Takumi thought he said. After their impromptu kiss, Takumi could barely hear or see, like his consciousness would fade at any moment. "Get a hold of yourself, Takumi!" he berated himself. He was finally pulled back into reality when Eito spoke again.</p><p>"Your face and mouth are so warm."</p><p>"I…" All this stuff Eito was saying made Takumi uncomfortable. He wasn't gay, for starters. At least, that's what he thought. But the feeling of Eito's tongue was something he would never forget. Surprisingly, he couldn't say that he hated it. But he didn't like it, either. Because he wasn't gay.</p><p>Despite this, Takumi's heart thumped rapidly in and out of his chest. "Are you alright?" he finally asked Eito.</p><p>"Better than ever. Is there still cake on your face?"</p><p>Wiping his face, and facing away from Eito, Takumi answered, "No!"</p><p>"You don't want me to check?"</p><p>"What is your deal? We're not addressing the elephant in the room here?"</p><p>"I wanted to know if something sweet, like cake, would cancel out the taste and smell of humans. But it just made everything more potent. It's quite sad, really, because–"</p><p>"That's wonderful," Takumi interrupted. "Let's just forget this ever happened."</p><p>"You're just going to forget your first kiss like that, Takumi? It was mine too, you know."</p><p>"That wasn't even a kiss! You just licked the inside of my mouth!"</p><p>"Isn't that all kissing is?"</p><p>"I-I don't think so!" It wasn't like what he had seen in movies or read in manga, but perhaps he just wasn't familiar with enough BL works.</p><p>As they continued arguing, someone else came into the Cafeteria. "What the hell are you guys talking about?"</p><p>Both of them faced towards the voice, Gaku. "N-nothing!" Takumi said, extremely unconvincingly.</p><p>"Your face is bright red! I know something's up!"</p><p>Suddenly, two other people showed up: the Tsukumo twins. "We heard you talking about kissing, Mr. Sumino," Ima said in his grating voice. "Me and Kako have a pretty good idea of what you were doing just now."</p><p>"That's right," Kako chimed in. "I'm glad we cracked the case so easily, too."</p><p>"No … NO!!!" Takumi cried.</p><p>"Ew, gross," Gaku said. "Wish it was two girls instead. I'm outta here." And with that, Gaku had promptly taken his leave.</p><p>While Gaku was attempting to leave, more people rushed in to the Cafeteria.</p><p>"I heard screaming! Is anyone hurt?" That was Tsubasa.</p><p>"Oh … I just heard what happened from Ima," Yugamu said. How did he do that so quickly? "I'm jealous of you, Eito."</p><p>Fuck. Takumi should have never rewound time. This timeline was the worst one. "No, no, I can explain!" he tried to say, but it fell on deaf ears.</p><p>Eito blushed. "It's exactly what it sounds like. I kissed Takumi. With tongue."</p><p>"No!!"</p><p>A soft voice spoke up. Nozomi's. "Takumi, is that really true?"</p><p>"NO!! Nozomi, it's not what it sounds like!"</p><p>"..."</p><p>"Nozomi!"</p><p>"I know you were helping Eito around the school earlier, but I didn't know that you two had gotten so close."</p><p>How did things end up like this? Why did things end up like this? Maybe not killing Eito was a mistake. But he couldn't rewind anymore. This was the reality he was stuck with.</p><p>"They've gotten close, alright," Yugamu said, making it fifty times worse.</p><p>Slowly, Nozomi exited the Cafeteria. "...I think I need some time. Alone."</p><p>"NOZOMI!"</p>
