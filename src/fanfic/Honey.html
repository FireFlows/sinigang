    <h2>Honey</h2>
      <p>"Sorry, I have to excuse myself to the bathroom." </p><p>Eito couldn't take it any longer; being in the vicinity of humans made him nauseous. Whenever he tried to throw up, however, he only ever dry heaved. So, he'd resorted to another method to keep his emotions in check.</p><p>He entered the leftmost stall, locked it, and took something out of his pocket. A brand-new box cutter he'd made with the Gift-O-Matic. The blade was sharp; he pricked himself on the thumb to test it, and a dot began to form. It was perfect. Eito rolled down his right sleeve to expose his forearm. </p><p>He'd done this many times before, as evidenced by the scars lining his arm. They were all of varying length and depth; some of them were even vertical. He ran his hand over the scar's bumps. A particularly old scar made him gasp — despite its age, the nerve endings hadn't quite healed yet. </p><p>Eito brought down the blade and swiftly cut near his wrist. His breath hitched as blood rose from the newly-formed cut, even though he barely scratched the surface of his skin. </p><p>The next few cuts were deeper. A sparkling red color flowed down his arm and onto his shoes. <em>Oops.</em> It wouldn't be too noticeable (his shoes were black, so it wouldn't look like much), but he still grimaced at the thought of someone worrying about him; it was disgusting. He didn't want any human's sympathy! He didn't need it, either. God, humans were so annoying with their faux virtuousness. </p><p>He hated, hated, <em>hated</em> them. Thinking about this, he continued. His arm became slick with blood, giving off a metallic smell. To be honest, it was a smell he enjoyed — it was better than what he often had to deal with, at least. </p><p>Using a bit more pressure than before, he cut even deeper into his skin, resulting in a large, gaping wound. This was the kind of gash that would require stitches later down the line, but he</p><p>Eito panted, touching his new cuts and staining his gloves. He had spare gloves in his pocket, so he didn't mind doing this. In a strange way, he derived a sort of pleasure from harming himself. He liked being in control. Sure, it was painful, but it was a different kind of pain than what he usually experienced. And after every session, he felt calm, even for a short while. </p><p>Just then: the sound of someone entering. "Hey, Eito, are you okay?" Takumi's grating voice echoed. "You've been in there for a while now."</p><p>Eito froze.<em> </em>"Please don't worry about me. I'll be out in a second." </p><p>"Oh, okay. I'll wait outside. Is that fine? You say not to worry, but everyone's worried about you, you know."</p><p>"It's fine." <em>It's not fine! </em>But Takumi was going to be stubborn and pushy as per usual. The bathroom door closed with a creak, and Eito withdrew the box cutter blade. Unfortunately, he failed to realize that blood had ended up on his <em>white</em> pants and <em>white</em> jacket and <em>white</em> sleeves. He cursed under his breath. Of course, this had to happen while Takumi was waiting right outside for him. Perhaps this was a taste of Gaku's daily life.</p><p>Carefully, he unlocked his stall and made his way to the sink. The cold water stung his open wounds as it was dyed crimson. Then, using a bit of soap, he went across the perimeter of his cuts, rinsed it off again, and put a thick gauze to his forearm. He had no time to stop the bleeding first, so this would have to do for now.</p><p>Eito glanced at the floor. No blood. </p><p>He rolled up his sleeve and took out a pair of new gloves. Unfortunately, he couldn't deal with the discoloration on his pants or jacket or sleeves, but he hoped it wouldn't draw too much attention. If he was quick about it, he could definitely avoid suspicion. </p><p>He opened the door. </p><p>"Eito! Are you okay?" Takumi asked. "What happened in there? There's blood all over your clothes!" If there was any color in Eito's face, it would've drained right out. </p><p>"Oh, I know what he was doing," Yugamu said way too confidently. <em>Where did he come from? </em>"He was masturbating."</p><p>"What kind of masturbating are you doing that involves — on second thought, I don't want to know."</p><p>"Oh, you sure don't, Takumi."</p><p>"A-anyway, Eito, seriously, did something happen?"</p><p>"Well…" He hadn't come up with a good excuse, despite having ample time. A bit embarrassing for him, actually. "I'm a lot more sensitive to cuts and scrapes than most people. So, sometimes, even when I barely get scratched, there ends up being a lot of blood everywhere… I didn't want to worry you all." </p><p>Not too bad. "Oh, sorry, I didn't know," Takumi spattered. </p><p>"It's fine, really. I'm used to it."</p><p>Yugamu stared at Eito with concern, but didn't say anything more. Eito began to head upstairs to the Roof, when a voice shouted at him. "Wait."</p><p>Eito turned around. It was, naturally, Takumi's grating voice again. "I'm glad you're okay, Eito." Takumi gave a warm smile to Eito, or, at least, Eito thought Takumi did. In truth, he couldn't tell because of his cognitive disorder, and also because Takumi was pretty far away.</p><p>Regardless, Eito mustered a smile back. "Thanks, Takumi. That means a lot to me. I'm glad that I have such a good friend like you."</p>
