  <h2>Perfection</h2>
      <p>Eito laid bare in front of Takumi, as ordered. The soft sheets of Takumi's bed smelled just like him, and Eito took long, deep breaths to really take in the scent. Eito got hard almost immediately, and his whole body turned bright red.</p><p>"Ah! Takumi-kun, I'm so sorry!"</p><p>"It's fine," he replied through gritted teeth, "it's only natural. This is your 'reward,' anyway, right?" </p><p>"I've never been naked in front of someone else before… even if it's you, it's difficult to get used to."</p><p>"We'll take it slow." Takumi was in the middle of pulling his bottom half when he noticed something. "Eito, are you okay?" </p><p>"I — are you talking about my scars?" </p><p>Indeed, there were horizontal, and occasionally vertical, scars running up and down Eito's arms and thighs. Some were deep, some looked more recent, and — did that one spell out Takumi? "Yes. I'm sorry, it slipped out of my mouth." In an even greater blunder, Takumi reached out to touch them, but stopped himself.</p><p>"Takumi-kun. Please touch them."</p><p>With barely any choice, Takumi touched Eito's shoulder and slid down until reaching his wrist, where the scars ended. Eito moaned slightly throughout, his breathing heavy. Pre-cum trickled down the head of his cock. </p><p>"Your hands feel so good, Takumi-kun…"</p><p>If Takumi could get away with not touching Eito's erection, he would. So, instead of going there, he felt the raised texture the scars made on Eito's thighs. He moaned louder, especially when Takumi touched the more recent-seeming ones. Eito even began to drool, his saliva dripping down onto Takumi's bedsheets. Still, he hadn't cum yet.</p><p>Takumi could tell he was close, though. "I'm so close," Eito said. Once again, Takumi avoided the most obvious option and decided to rub Eito's (newly hardened) nipples while on top of him. </p><p>This sensation finally allowed Eito to cum. He let out a loud moan as semen splattered the top of Takumi's jacket. "S-sorry!" Eito squealed.</p><p>Takumi shouldn't have been doing this with clothes on, anyway; it was kind of his fault. He quickly got off Eito and removed his clothes (for real this time). With both of them completely naked, the size difference was obvious, and almost embarrassing. </p><p>And in a few seconds, Eito was already hard again, like he never came in the first place. Takumi looked down; at some point, he had begun to spring an erection as well. </p><p>"Takumi-kun, I love how small your penis is."</p><p>… Come on. It wasn't even that small. Smaller than Eito's, sure, but so were most penises. It was very obvious when Eito was hard, even when he wore his usual clothes that obscured his figure. To be fair, Eito hadn't seen many dicks in his life. Of course Takumi's would come off as abnormally tiny. </p><p>Takumi shook his head. No, he shouldn't be thinking about this. Let's just get it over with. He climbed up on the bed and kneeled right above Eito's cock. He paused for a second while Eito gave an impatient look. Takumi coughed and steeled himself before bringing his ass down to Eito's tip.</p><p>Suddenly, Eito moved his hips forward and thrust his erection deep into Takumi. Since his cock was already wet with cum, that was easy, but it still gave Takumi a shock. He felt a pang in his heart, sputtered, and let out an involuntary groan.</p><p> "A-ah!" Eito screamed, "I'm sorry, it just moved on its own!"</p><p>"It's fine," Takumi reassured him, trying to regain oxygen. "You don't need to apologize so much."</p><p>"You're so kind. That's why I love you so much, Takumi-kun."</p><p>Not wanting to lie, Takumi replied by continuing to ride Eito. His whole body rhythmically moved in circles, while Eito's hands grabbed Takumi's hips like he needed them for stability. In fact, Takumi was grateful for this, since it gave him something to hold on to, as well. Even though he didn't want it to, it did feel good, and Takumi's breathing quickened. </p><p>Takumi's soft hands went over Eito's scars once more. Eito gave a sigh of pleasure. But Takumi just wondered how long he had been doing this for. And why hadn't he ever noticed? (Should he ask, or would that be too inappropriate?)</p><p>Their heartbeats were in sync; Takumi could feel Eito's dick pulsate inside him every time his own heart pulsated. Eito held onto Takumi tighter, digging into his skin. "I think I'm going to —"</p><p>Eito came inside Takumi. </p><p>Slowly, Takumi pulled himself out and Eito stood up. Takumi didn't cum, but he'd take care of that later.</p><p>"I have to take a shower," Takumi said, emotionlessly. "Alone."</p><p>"I'll go in right after you finish."</p><p>"...Yeah."</p><p>*</p><p>Eito really, really, really loved Takumi. He didn't care if it was because of some pill: he finally felt like he had a reason to keep living. </p><p>Having sex for the first time, with Takumi nonetheless, was absolutely perfect. He'd heard Takumi was a virgin, too. Not only did he cum twice, he masturbated a couple dozen times while reliving that experience in the past week. His dick was painfully hard almost constantly around Takumi now. In every conversation, Takumi stared at Eito's forehead, although he'd usually look at the floor. </p><p>Today, Eito had touched himself around five times. His penis swelled and ached, but he still had a tiny amount of ecstasy he couldn't get rid of. To alleviate his discomfort, he rolled his sleeve and grabbed his razor blade from the bathroom. Eito slashed his forearm quickly and cleanly.</p><p>"Ah…" Some of his wounds had reopened. He took deep breaths, and cut again. "Hngh…Takumi-kun…"</p><p>Even now, he was thinking about Takumi. He couldn't help it; he loved him enough to carve Takumi's name on his skin. Would he like it if he knew how many times Eito had jerked off to him?</p><p>Blood from his cuts trickled down his skin and into the sink — a cathartic release. With every cut, he felt more in control, his breathing slowed, and his head became clearer. He thought about Takumi bandaging his cuts. "Don't worry, Aotsuki," he'd say, "let me help you with that," and then he'd lick Eito's cuts and kiss his old scars and put on bandages while rubbing Eito with his knee. </p><p>Unfortunately, he had to bandage these cuts himself. After the sink had been dyed red, he ran his new wounds over the running water and wrapped his arm in a gauze. </p><p>A knock on his door. Glad that it wasn't a few minutes earlier, he opened it to see … </p><p>"Oh? Takumi-kun, why are you here?"<br>
<br>
"Good afternoon, Aotsuki. We just hadn't seen you come out of your room yet, but we're all eating lunch in the Cafeteria, if you would like to join us."</p><p>"Would you like me to join you?"<br>
<br>
"That's what I'm asking you. But, yes, I would."</p><p>"Okay." Of course, he dreaded seeing everyone else's ugly faces, but with Takumi, it should be a bit more tolerable. "Okay, I'll come with you. Can you hold my hand?"</p><p>"…Sure. I'll hold your hand, Aotsuki. But don't get too excited."</p><p>It was a bit too late for that, but Eito smiled and grabbed Takumi's hand. "I love you."<br>
<br>
Takumi didn't look at Eito. He quickly ran to the Cafeteria, dragging Eito along like a tassel. He forced Eito to let go before opening the door.</p>
