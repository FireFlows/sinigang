<p>
Eitaku is the ship name between Eito Aotsuki and Takumi Sumino from the 2025 video game The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy-. Depending on who you think tops or bottoms, the ship is sometimes called takuei (with Takumi topping/Eito bottoming). I don't really have a preference, but I'll be using eitaku here since it's the most common name among English-speaking fans.</p>
<p>
It's truly the perfect ship for me. I love ships fueled by mutual hatred that turn into homoeroticism (or were homoerotic to begin with!). I love obsessive ships. I love the potential eitaku has for writing, fanfiction, etc. I have written, drawn, and imagined many different scenarios with them. They're like my toys. My toys that I play with.
</p>
<p>
While 001 is probably my favorite route in general, my favorite eitaku route is 042. Firstly, the CG. Let's talk about that fucking CG for a second: when I first saw it, I thought it was from a fangame or some shit. I was like, there's no way this is seriously in the game! And then I got to see it for the first time on my tiny ass Switch Lite. I was shocked! I've only seen this kind of shit in BL games. Perhaps Hundred Line is a BL game. If so, they seriously need to work on the other routes.</p>
<p>
042 is fanservice, but it's also terrifying. In general, the whole Cult of Takumi route is psychological horror. Of course it's fun to be like "haha gay sex CG haha eitaku yes!" but I genuinely felt a pit in my stomach after completing it... which is why I love thinking about it so much. I love psychological horror.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's fun to see Eito deeply in love with Takumi to a concerning degree, even more than usual! I can easily imagine he'd do a ton of depraved shit (see my fics that I've written). He hates everyone in the world besides Takumi... that's so beautiful.</p>
<p>I also enjoy Casual, Multiple Eitos... and Killing Game <i>should</i> have absolutely legendary fanfics and fanart but people don't really talk about the eitaku potential in that one for some reason. Why not? Did you guys, like, not play that one? He wants to touch Takumi <i>so bad</i> but he can't because of the rules??? Excuse me. This is why I think Eito's gay but in denial. <s>Okay I don't really care if people don't talk about Killing Game honestly I think you should pretty much do whatever you want all the time.</s></p>
