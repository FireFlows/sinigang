	<h2>WARNING</h2>
			<p>My website is for <b>mature audiences only</b>. My fics (which I've hosted here!) contain gore (especially self-harm) and are occasionally sexually explicit. There are suggestive and gory drawings. I talk about R18 games. I say bad words.</p>
			<p>My main browser is Firefox (no relation) and this was coded on VSCode with a 1920x1200 display. Should work with most resolutions and mobile, but I recommend viewing on a PC/laptop for best experience.</p>
			<p>Additionally, <b>there are tons of spoilers for Hundred Line</b>, for a bunch of routes (mainly route 0/the first 100 days).</p>
			<p>I don't tag spoilers or any mature content (besides my fics). If you are under the age of 18 or uncomfortable with the topics shown on this website, please do not continue further.</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Hi, my name is Fire and this is my website. It's a <b>major work-in-progress</b> right now, but I'm slowly but surely working on it! </p>
		<p>While I've had neocities for a long time (my page was created on August 18th, 2020), I've only started to get into it very recently. I have a growing resentment for social media and I want my own, unique space. I decided to blow off the dust on my HTML skills and try my hand at coding a website.</p>
		<p>If you have any questions, concerns, etc. about my website, please feel free to <a href="about.html#contact">contact me</a>. While my message requests for Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr are open, I rarely check them, so the fastest response will always be via email!</p>
		<p>I like <a href="eito.html">Eito Aotsuki</a> and the color purple. I'm a huge eitakuei fan! </p>
		<p>Sinigang is a sour Filipino soup. I'm bad at coming up with usernames, and I thought it would be fun to name my page after it.</p>

Written: You are a Dandere! People see you as emotionless due to you being quiet/silent. You will only open up to people who make an effort to get to know you, this is usually due to being super shy.
