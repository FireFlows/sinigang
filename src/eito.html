	<h2>how did we get here?</h2>
		<p>People who know me know that I really, really, really like Eito. I have a crush on him, honestly, but I don't ship myself with him. This is mainly because I do not think he'd like me at all. Of course, he doesn't like anyone. Except for Takumi, probably.</p>
		<p>I mainly like Eito because I think he's cute. He's a shy, tall guy with glasses which is my taste in fictional men to a T. I knew from the second I saw him he was going to be one of my favorite characters of all time. In fact, he is my favorite character of all time. Because he's so cute. Even after the reveal of him being like evil or whatever. To be honest, it's something I didn't expect. I didn't really know who the traitor was but retrospectively the signs were totally there.</p>
		<p>I feel so bad for him as a little kid because his cognitive disorder is not his fault at all. OMG. Not a cognitive disorder but I have autism and I deeply relate to a lot of his backstory. I wasn't very well-liked as a kid and spent most of my time reading a book instead of playing with my peers. Though I did not grow up to kill my parents or set fire to a hospital.</p>
		<p>Nobody really tried to understand little Eito, either. He was disliked and sent to a (live-in) hospital at a young age by his own parents. It's awful. I was diagnosed autistic late so I can 100% relate to nobody understanding me or why I "act like that" etc. Eito's whole lore is a beautiful allegory for the late-diagnosed autistic. Thank you Eito for the best autism representation. ...Um, not the killing people thing though!</p>
