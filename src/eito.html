	<h2>How did we get here?</h2>
	<p>It's been <b><span id="Age"></span></b> since June 2nd, 2025, when I played Hundred Line for the first time and was first introduced to Eito Aotsuki!</p>

		function getAge() {

			let days = Math.floor(diff / dayInMillis);
			diff = diff - (days * dayInMillis);

			let hours = Math.floor(diff / hourInMillis);
			diff = diff -(hours*hourInMillis)

			let mins = Math.floor(diff/minInMillis);
			diff = diff -(mins*minInMillis)

			document.getElementById("Age").innerText = formattedTime;

		<p>Which is a pretty long time. When I played for the first time, I thought, I'm totally going to get hopelessly attached to Eito Aotsuki, aren't I? And here we are!</p>
		<p>I love Eito. I often say I have a crush on him, and my mom knows him as my "boyfriend." I don't <i>actually</i> ship myself with him (mainly because I don't think he would like me at all), but he brings me a lot of joy.</p>
		<p>But why? Why do I like him so much? And, well, <b>how did we get here?</b></p>
		<p>Firstly, I like cute male characters. Eito definitely fits that description. He is a beautiful bishounen boy. And he wears glasses! Increases his moe factor. When you first meet him, he comments on how it's hard for him to understand people, which is relatable and <i>so fucking cute</i>.</p>	
		<p>Perhaps it's bad to say, but he is a very relatable character. I know how it feels to have no idea what's wrong with you, to read books instead of talking to other kids, to live as a disabled person in a society who hates disabled people. I can relate to being awkward and not good with people. What I cannot relate to, however, is killing my parents or destroying hospitals.</p>
		<p>Listen. <i>Listen.</i> He did all that, but... I get it. Humans and humanity are fucking awful, so I get Eito. He's supposed to be a "villain" in Hundred Line, but every single day I start to understand him more and more.</p>
		<p>Somehow, my favorite characters always end up having a <i>complicated</i> relationship with another man. Eito has such a big crush on Takumi, it's so funny he doesn't even realize that in most routes.</p>
		<p>I could talk about Eito, and why I like him, for the rest of my life but the main reasons are that a. he's cute b. he's relatable and c. he's gay (for Takumi, and that increases the cuteness factor by a bajillion). Though, I love shipping him with lots of characters. One of my favorite Hundred Line ships is Eito and Darumi! But eitakuei is my forever OTP.</p>
		<p>As much as I like Eito, I completely get the people who hate him and are sick of him LMFAO. I'm able to respect everyone's opinions. <b>Love and peace!</b></p>
