"In almost every case, layout tables can be replaced with other HTML 
elements and styled with CSS to achieve the desired visual presentation. 
If the table contains tabular data, provide appropriate header (<th>) 
cells. If the layout table remains, verify that the reading and navigation 
order of table content (based on underlying source code order) is logical 
and give it role="presentation" to ensure it is not 
identified as a table to screen reader users."
